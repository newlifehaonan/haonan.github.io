##Elementary-Sort<a id ='Elementary-sort'></a>
**1. Selection-Sort<a id ='Bubble-sort'></a>**

_Start with the first item in Array, compare each of them to the rest of item in the array_



**2. Bubble-Sort<a id ='Selection-sort'></a>**

_Start with the first item in array, compare each of them to the item next to it, put the larger one in behind_

**3. Insertion-Sort<a id ='Insertion-sort'></a>**

_assume the array behind the item is sorted, insert items that need to be sorted into the correct place in the sorted array_

**4. Shell-Sort<a id ='Shell-sort'></a>**

_split the array into different size, apply Insertion-sort in each array until the array size become 1. (the sequence of step length should be 1,4,7,9,11,3*k+1_

<hr />

##Heap-Sort<a id ='Heap-sort'></a>

_Heap structure is a data structure that each node are linked with the other two nodes, and each parent node needs to be either larger or smaller than its child nodes._

**1. Max-Priority-Queue**

**2. Min-Priority-Queue**

**3. Heap-base-Sort**

##Merge-Sort<a id ='Merge-sort'></a>
**1. Divide**

**2. Conquer**

##Quick-Sort<a id ='Quick-sort'></a>
**1. Divide**

**2. Conquer**
